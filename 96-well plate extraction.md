# Extraction of metabolites from single culture in 96-well plate

### Protocol

#### A. Liquid culture
1. To a new extraction plate, add 120ul of Acetonitrile: Methanol = 50:50
2. Add in 60ul of culture from the overnight 96-well plate
3. Store it in -20°C fridge for 1 hr
4. After an hr in the fridge, incubate at 650 rpm at 4°C
5. Spin it max at 3000 rpm for 10 mins
6. Transfer 80ul of supernatant to autosampler plate and apply the rubber mat

#### B. Pellet
1. Pellets have to be resuspended first in 60ul of water. Can use beads and the shaking incubator to do it. 
2. Add in 120 ul of Acetonitrile: Methanol = 50:50
3. Store it in -20 fridge for 1 hr
4. Take it out, incubate at 650 rpm at 4 (program 5) for 10 mins
5. Spin it max at 3000 rpm for 10 mins
