## Cecal Content Extraction for NMR

#### Protocol
1.	Spin the samples at low speed (**700 rpm, 1 mins**) to separate bacterial content from the rest of the cecal content particles.
2.	Wash **1ml** of cecal content with **800ul** of PBS 3 times (Centrifuge at **3000rpm for 3mins**, add 800 ul PBS, vortex, spin it down and add 800ul of PBS again) (*Disclaimer: Do not add cysteine to PBS*). 
3.	To the final pellet after the third washing, vortex and add **1ml** of pre-cooled methanol:H2O (2:1)
4.	Homogenize samples for 6500 20sec in the homogenizer to the homogenization tubes.
5.	Freeze-thaw 3 times with liquid nitrogen (Will take a few time).
6.	Centrifuge at 3200g for 10 minutes at 4oC.
7.	Weigh new 2ml Eppendorf tubes and note their weights (This is to note their dry weight of the freeze dried materials)
8.	Transfer supernatants to 2ml EP tubes. 
9.	Add 1ml solution (methanol:H2O (2:1)) to the pellets on the homogenization tube and **repeat 2-5**.
10.	Combine the supernatants for each sample.
11.	Dry down in Speed-Vac (Usually takes 5-6 hrs.) 
12.	Next step is freeze drying. Take out the tubes and cover with parafilm (not the lid) and poke 3-4 holes on it. 
13.	Freeze them in -80oC for at least >10 mins before transferring to freeze dryer. 
14.	Freeze dry in a freeze dryer, takes 5-6 hrs. (Easier to leave it overnight)
15.	Take the weight of the tubes after drying (subtract the tube weight, to get the dry weight)
16.	Add 550ul to 600ul of 0.1M PBS (D2O), centrifuge at max speed for 10min at 4oC. OR
Add 60 ul of 0.1M PBS (D2O), centrifuge at max speed for 10min at 4oC.
17.	Transfer 550ul (or 50ul) supernatants to NMR tubes. 
18.	Give to NMR guys.
 
Preparation of 0.1M PBS solution containing 50% D2O.
1.        0.1M Na+/K+PO4 Buffer (100ml, pH=7.4)
2.        K2HPO4 : 0.8*100(ml)*0.1M*174.18/1000/0.99 = 1.408g
3.        NaH2PO4 : 0.2 * 100ml * 0.1M * 119.98/1000/0.99 = 0.242g
4.        H2O: 100ml*0.5  = 50ml
5.        D2O: 100ml * 0.5 = 50m
6.        TSP: 0.005% (w/v)*100 = 0.005g
